This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the _Chirpy_ template, and it's worth reading even if you've used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.

# Naming and Path
## Comments

The global switch of comments is defined by variable `comments.active` in the file `_config.yml`{: .filepath}. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.

If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the **Front Matter** of the post:

```yaml
---
comments: false
---
```

### Images

#### Caption

Add italics to the next line of an image, then it will become the caption and appear at the  bottom of the image:

```markdown
![img-description](/path/to/image)
_Image Caption_
```
{: .nolineno}
